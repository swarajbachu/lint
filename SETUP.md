# Set up @shadcn/lint

Install and register `@shadcn/lint` in the user's project. Do not enable
new rules or change existing rule policies. Once setup is complete, help
the user find where to configure their rules.

Read the [setup and configuration documentation](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/lint/blob/main/README.md#get-started)
before making changes. The examples there enable rules; use their plugin
and parser setup without adding those rules.

## Inspect the project

- Detect the package manager from the project metadata and lockfile.
- Determine whether this is a single project or a monorepo/workspace.
  Find the apps, shared UI packages, lint configs, and task runner.
- Use the existing ESLint or Oxlint setup. If both are present, register
  the plugin with the one that checks UI files, without duplicating it.
  If the project uses Biome, keep it and add the standalone `shadcn-lint`
  command to the same check workflow. If none is present, set up Oxlint.
  Check Node.js and linter version compatibility against the documentation.
- Find the component directories, import aliases, and Tailwind v4 themes.
  Use `components.json` where available. For custom setups, consult the
  [discovery documentation](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/lint/blob/main/docs/how-it-works.md)
  and configure only the settings the project needs.

## Install and register the plugin

Use the project's package manager. Install dependencies in the package
that owns the lint configuration. In a workspace, follow the existing
shared-config and dependency conventions.

Preserve existing rules, parsers, scripts, and ignores. For Biome, create
`shadcn-lint.config.ts` and compose `biome check . && shadcn-lint .` without
changing `biome.json`. Register the
plugin through `plugins` for ESLint or `jsPlugins` for Oxlint. Keep the
framework's parser configuration; add a JSX/TSX parser setup if needed.
Do not add rule presets, enable new rules, or add rule overrides.

In a workspace, account for shared component imports and each app's
theme. Scope any discovery settings to the relevant apps and packages.
Avoid replacing app-specific settings with one workspace-wide value.

Ensure the lint command works with the project's scripts and workspace
task runner. Reuse the existing command where possible; add one if needed.

## Verify and hand off

Run the relevant lint commands to check that the configuration loads.
Separate configuration errors from existing lint findings. With no new
rules enabled, this verifies setup, not design-system enforcement.

Tell the user:

- What was installed and which configuration files changed.
- How to run lint, including workspace commands where applicable.
- That no new `@shadcn/lint` rules were enabled. If the project already
  had rules configured, explain that those were preserved.
- Where to add rules, and where to read the
  [available rules](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/lint/blob/main/README.md#rules)
  and [configuration examples](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/lint/blob/main/docs/design-systems.md).

Leave choosing rules and defining what is allowed to the user.
